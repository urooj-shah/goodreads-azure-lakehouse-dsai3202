Holmes. The curious American doctor who built a crazy house in Chicago with gas chambers, hidden rooms and a furnace too big and too powerful for domestic use. So it's somewhat bizarre that even though Holmes was caught and tried and executed, there's something quite unknowable about him. We know who he was, but the why, even the how a lot of the time, remains an utter mystery. \n",
       " At the time the fact that such a man existed wasn't bloody grist to the mill of Sunday Magazine Supplements. There was not only a feeling that the gory details should be kept away from the general public, but a move even to limit the scope of the enquiry. We have no idea how many people he killed. His case was never fully examined in a court of law, as if his evil - if exposed - would turn out to be contagious. \n",
       " These days the media would have more than a feeding frenzy, it would be - I don't know - a devouring delirium. No detail, regardless of how small, would be ignored. All, from the brand of toothpaste he used outwards, would be given a sinister spin. There's evidence here that there was a certain amount of that appetite already there, but from a 21st century perspective one can't help but be amazed at how restrained the 19th century versions of us actually were. \n",
       " We've obviously performed a high-speed 180 since the late Victorian era, to the extent that true-crime fiction of today generally and justifiably gets a bad press, because a lot of it is just there to be salacious and to titillate man's desire for darkness. It's the outer edge of the tabloidisation of society. \n",
       " THE DEVIL IN THE WHITE CITY is the upper end of the scale though, a world away from those tawdry paperbacks with bloody knives on the cover. It's smart, beautiful gripping, page turning with a fine sense of history. \n",
       " I did wonder, as I started reading, whether the decision to alternate Holmes's story with the contemporaneous design and construction of the World's Fair in Chicago would prove to be a wise one. After all, surely a serial killer is going to be far more fascinating than a bunch of architects sat in smoky rooms arguing. But Holmes is such a cypher in his own story that he really does take the idea of the banality of evil to a whole other level. We hear about his charm and mesmeric effect, but - boy! - he seems boring. As such Larson has to do the heavy lifting in the other side of the narrative, and really does take the architects' story and make it really grip. So much so that I was actually rooting for plucky Chicago to find a statement piece that would live up to the previous fair's Eiffel Tower. \n",
       " SPOILER ALERT: They did and it was called The Ferris Wheel. \n",
       " The fact that this book could make me care about the ins and outs, ups and downs of a construction project a hundred plus years back and thousands of miles away - so that it almost seems more interesting than a deadly, notorious serial killer - just shows that this book is practically a work of genius. \n",

Nothing exciting or that great about it so I wouldn't really recommend running to go read it. The hero was Native American (\"Indian\") and he never lets the heroine or the reader forget it. He thought the whole while world was out to get him, which got a little old after awhile. Here is a synopsis of the story: \n",
       " Lucas Greywolf was sent to prison for 3 years for staging a Native American rally that got violent and ended with police officers seriously injured. So he got sent to prison for 3 years even though he wasn't involved in the fight (yeah right). He escapes jail (we are never given the details of this miracle) because he wants to see his grandfather before he dies. Aislinn Andrews finds Lucas in her home after he broke in to find some food. He takes her hostage and forces her to take him to his grandfather's house in her car. He is pretty mean to her but doesn't physically harm her. Once there, he gets to see his grandfather for a few hours before his death. Aislinn feels sorry Lucas and they make love right before the police show up and send him back to prison. \n",
       " Nine months later, Lucas is released from prison and goes to Aislinn to thank her for not telling authorities he kidnapped her. Once there, he finds out she had a son as a result of their love making. He threatens her with all kinds of things to try to make her marry him and move to the reservation with him. She doesn't give in right away, not until her parents show up and try to get her to give Lucas her son because they don't want her to be an unwed mother. So Aislinn decides to marry Lucas and move away with him to his horse ranch. This is where the story started to annoy me because Lucas treated her like crap despite the fact that she was always nice and considerate of him. He was \"afraid of love\" and didn't want to love a white girl (hello? he was a half-breed with a white father!). He is only sort of nice to her once or twice in the whole book, the only thing we are sure of is that he wants to sleep with her. They eventually work things out and he thaws a little bit in his attitude toward Aislinn. The only thing in the positive for him was that he loved his son right away. \n",
       " Lucas was a typical 80's hero, a hard man who treated the heroine coldly because he didn't want to love her. Parts of the story were interesting, I like kidnapping plots. The book could have been better if long time periods weren't glossed over and more detail would have been given on the characters actions and feelings. So overall, an average read with an interesting plot idea that wasn't executed as well as it should have been and a hero that needed to lose the huge chip on his shoulder.</td><td></td><td>5</td><td>Tue Oct 14 05:24:53 -0700 2008</td></tr></tbody></table></div>"

But Libba Bray addressed many serious issues in a funny and light hearted way. \n Overall, it was an easy, humorous read which I enjoyed despite many crazy and ridiculous aspects.",

We get a touch of what has made Nathan who he is. We see heartbreak, a broken childhood, a need to love someone and be loved. Nathan is a jerk, yeah, but he is oh so much more....We get to witness the beginnings of, if not a friendship, at least some grudging respect between Trev and Nathan. And a perfect set up for the next novel...As usual, this is well written with deep characters. The back and forth banter is amazing! With each book, the writing gets better, smoother....This series is handsdown my favorite because of the realistic characters. Each character has flaws, secrets, something that make them real and not just words and descriptions on paper. Just utterly amazing!",

         "After East-End Jack, the only other Victorian serial killer people could name would probably be H.H. Holmes. The curious American doctor who built a crazy house in Chicago with gas chambers, hidden rooms and a furnace too big and too powerful for domestic use. So it's somewhat bizarre that even though Holmes was caught and tried and executed, there's something quite unknowable about him. We know who he was, but the why, even the how a lot of the time, remains an utter mystery. \n At the time the fact that such a man existed wasn't bloody grist to the mill of Sunday Magazine Supplements. There was not only a feeling that the gory details should be kept away from the general public, but a move even to limit the scope of the enquiry. We have no idea how many people he killed. His case was never fully examined in a court of law, as if his evil - if exposed - would turn out to be contagious. \n These days the media would have more than a feeding frenzy, it would be - I don't know - a devouring delirium. No detail, regardless of how small, would be ignored. All, from the brand of toothpaste he used outwards, would be given a sinister spin. There's evidence here that there was a certain amount of that appetite already there, but from a 21st century perspective one can't help but be amazed at how restrained the 19th century versions of us actually were. \n We've obviously performed a high-speed 180 since the late Victorian era, to the extent that true-crime fiction of today generally and justifiably gets a bad press, because a lot of it is just there to be salacious and to titillate man's desire for darkness. It's the outer edge of the tabloidisation of society. \n THE DEVIL IN THE WHITE CITY is the upper end of the scale though, a world away from those tawdry paperbacks with bloody knives on the cover. It's smart, beautiful gripping, page turning with a fine sense of history. \n I did wonder, as I started reading, whether the decision to alternate Holmes's story with the contemporaneous design and construction of the World's Fair in Chicago would prove to be a wise one. After all, surely a serial killer is going to be far more fascinating than a bunch of architects sat in smoky rooms arguing. But Holmes is such a cypher in his own story that he really does take the idea of the banality of evil to a whole other level. We hear about his charm and mesmeric effect, but - boy! - he seems boring. As such Larson has to do the heavy lifting in the other side of the narrative, and really does take the architects' story and make it really grip. So much so that I was actually rooting for plucky Chicago to find a statement piece that would live up to the previous fair's Eiffel Tower. \n SPOILER ALERT: They did and it was called The Ferris Wheel. \n The fact that this book could make me care about the ins and outs, ups and downs of a construction project a hundred plus years back and thousands of miles away - so that it almost seems more interesting than a deadly, notorious serial killer - just shows that this book is practically a work of genius. \n Not tawdry, not sensationalist, instead narrative history at its definite best. \n If you get chance, please visit my blog for book, TV and film reviews - as well as whatever else takes my fancy - at frjameson.com \n LIke my Facebook page \n Or follow me on Twitter or Instagram: @frjameson.",

         "Honor Bound was an okay read. Nothing exciting or that great about it so I wouldn't really recommend running to go read it. The hero was Native American (\"Indian\") and he never lets the heroine or the reader forget it. He thought the whole while world was out to get him, which got a little old after awhile. Here is a synopsis of the story: \n Lucas Greywolf was sent to prison for 3 years for staging a Native American rally that got violent and ended with police officers seriously injured. So he got sent to prison for 3 years even though he wasn't involved in the fight (yeah right). He escapes jail (we are never given the details of this miracle) because he wants to see his grandfather before he dies. Aislinn Andrews finds Lucas in her home after he broke in to find some food. He takes her hostage and forces her to take him to his grandfather's house in her car. He is pretty mean to her but doesn't physically harm her. Once there, he gets to see his grandfather for a few hours before his death. Aislinn feels sorry Lucas and they make love right before the police show up and send him back to prison. \n Nine months later, Lucas is released from prison and goes to Aislinn to thank her for not telling authorities he kidnapped her. Once there, he finds out she had a son as a result of their love making. He threatens her with all kinds of things to try to make her marry him and move to the reservation with him. She doesn't give in right away, not until her parents show up and try to get her to give Lucas her son because they don't want her to be an unwed mother. So Aislinn decides to marry Lucas and move away with him to his horse ranch. This is where the story started to annoy me because Lucas treated her like crap despite the fact that she was always nice and considerate of him. He was \"afraid of love\" and didn't want to love a white girl (hello? he was a half-breed with a white father!). He is only sort of nice to her once or twice in the whole book, the only thing we are sure of is that he wants to sleep with her. They eventually work things out and he thaws a little bit in his attitude toward Aislinn. The only thing in the positive for him was that he loved his son right away. \n Lucas was a typical 80's hero, a hard man who treated the heroine coldly because he didn't want to love her. Parts of the story were interesting, I like kidnapping plots. The book could have been better if long time periods weren't glossed over and more detail would have been given on the characters actions and feelings. So overall, an average read with an interesting plot idea that wasn't executed as well as it should have been and a hero that needed to lose the huge chip on his shoulder.",

  it's a yuletide miracle, charlie brown by stephanie perkins- 5 stars- no surprise here. i loved this. i connected to the characters, i found it to be believable, and the romance was cute!!!   your temporary santa by david levithan- 3 stars- i love that this had lgbt characters in it, as is david levithan's style, but i didn't really connect to the story, sadly.   krampuslauf by holly black- 2 stars- this was my first holly black and i was not impressed. i did not like the direction it took and i didn't feel it flowed with the rest of the stories.   what the hell have you done, sophie roth by gayle forman- 4 stars- this was also my first gayle forman and i was impressed. another believable story and romance.   beer buckets and baby jesus by myra mcentire- 4 stars- this was cute and felt very much like a hallmark movie or a christmas themed episode of a show like gilmore girls, in a good way!

it was alright. a decent new adult novel, but some things did start to grate on me. i know this is a matter of personal taste, but i think the emphasis on memory's accent was distracting. her speech, and some parts of her narration, were written in her accent, and i feel like this distracts from the narrative and i find it quite jarring. perhaps because i'm british and i'm just not used to strong southern american accents. i don't know, but i found it tiresome. saying that, i understand why the author made this decision, and i know not everyone would feel the same as me about the choice. different strokes for different folks and what have you.   i found the romance in this novel too easy, also. it took a while for jace to warm up to memory, and once he did we sort of saw them together once or twice and then there was a time jump and a brief moment that was supposed to be the climax and then everything was happy. i wasn't invested enough in them to care when their relationship looked like it could end, and i thought the rest of the book after this moment was a bit too sugary-sweet. she is struggling with brain cancer, and when she graduates, for example, she walks across the stage and they play different music for her and everyone screams and shouts, and they all wear her initials on their graduation caps. it's a bit too unrealistic for me. everyone seems to love her. i thought the message of 'live life to the fullest because you never know when it'll end' was incredibly heavy-handed and overdone; it wasn't subtle - i felt like it was being pushed onto the reader a bit too much.   memory and jace are fairly weak characters, also. i said that i didn't care much about their relationship, and this is because i didn't care much about them. at the beginning, we're introduced to jace as someone who is very straight-laced and who has a major grudge against drunk drivers (more so than the average person), but this is never explained or expanded on after this. memory is a bit of a caricature, i found. she was fun-loving and wild and whatever, and there wasn't much more to her personality. i just felt like we could've had more depth with the characters.   new adult contemporary novels hinge on depth of character, because their plots are very similar. you have to fall in love with the characters and the writing for the novel to stand out amongst the sea of similar ones. unfortunately, this book did neither for me, and i found it a bit of a disappointment. it's an average na novel, and i can see some people liking it, but overall it did nothing for me!</td><td>557</td><td>2992</td><td>2015-08-31</td><td>29</td><td>3.8620689655172415</td></tr><tr><td>4bd84bd16e193ce4e05588011f0f9145</td><td>bef7bfe7f3c5a03df01217de2c2a9cf0</td><td>13722902</td><td>3371</td><td>Dave Eggers</td><td>A Hologram for the King</td><td>eng</td><td>0</td><td>3.0</td><td>i have to admit that this is my first dave eggars, and it was ok. i can tell he's a talented writer, but i had a major misgiving with a major choice he made. so, i guess what i need to do is to judge eggars by his other well-known books: a heartbreaking work of staggering genius, what is the what, and you shall know our velocity.   this book is about a middle-aged salesman who has gone to saudi arabia to sell the king a new teleconferencing technology. the salesman - a bit of a modern willy loman - is named alan clay. clay has failed at other businesses, mainly because the world changed on him; america became less about making products (like bicycles) and more about selling knowledge (like holographic teleconferencing technology). clay is divorced from a fiery, somewhat egoistic wife; he is also paying his daughter's way through columbia, so he must make this sale in a business he doesn't understand too well. he is depending on his old-school salesman charm in a country and a world that is foreign to him, with culture, habits, and mores that are odd and precarious.   i get what eggars is saying. perhaps, like america lost its manufacturing edge, we will lose our technological savvy, too. our old skills will leave us abandoned and lonely, like loman and clay. globalism is knocking the world's king - america - off it's capitalistic throne. for clay to not end up like loman, he must adjust to the new world order.   all that is awesome. however, i kept flashing back to the famous death of a salesman line: \"attention must be paid.\" does it? does clay deserve our attention?   eggars seems to think so. (or why would he write the book)? however, eggars does something so wrongheaded that he hinders his protagonist's ability to capture our hearts and build empathy. eggars tells the story in third person. this choice creates distance and drains the story of its ability to affect us. even though there is not a single page of this story that clay isn't on - not a single moment clay isn't living through - eggars chooses to talk about clay in a dispassionate, omnipotent voice instead of truly getting into his protagonist's heart and head.   eggars reminded me of why i dislike another author, don delillo - all the cold reporting. i was frustrated, because i wasn't deeply invested in clay, despite the interesting economic and cultural comments eggars was making. instead, the story was more like a news report than a novel. i understood, but the chilly approach made me care less than i could have.</td><td>444</td><td>2523</td><td>2012-09-04</td><td>303</td><td>3.3003300330033003</td></tr></tbody></table></div>"

         "this book is the third in a trilogy of companion novels. i read the first book in the series (stupid girl) a while ago, but missed out on the second. they can each be read as a standalone though - i didn't remember much from the first book at all. the only thing i knew was that jace, the main character in this novel, is the brother of the protagonist from book 1.   anyway, what did i think of this book? it was alright. a decent new adult novel, but some things did start to grate on me. i know this is a matter of personal taste, but i think the emphasis on memory's accent was distracting. her speech, and some parts of her narration, were written in her accent, and i feel like this distracts from the narrative and i find it quite jarring. perhaps because i'm british and i'm just not used to strong southern american accents. i don't know, but i found it tiresome. saying that, i understand why the author made this decision, and i know not everyone would feel the same as me about the choice. different strokes for different folks and what have you.   i found the romance in this novel too easy, also. it took a while for jace to warm up to memory, and once he did we sort of saw them together once or twice and then there was a time jump and a brief moment that was supposed to be the climax and then everything was happy. i wasn't invested enough in them to care when their relationship looked like it could end, and i thought the rest of the book after this moment was a bit too sugary-sweet. she is struggling with brain cancer, and when she graduates, for example, she walks across the stage and they play different music for her and everyone screams and shouts, and they all wear her initials on their graduation caps. it's a bit too unrealistic for me. everyone seems to love her. i thought the message of 'live life to the fullest because you never know when it'll end' was incredibly heavy-handed and overdone; it wasn't subtle - i felt like it was being pushed onto the reader a bit too much.   memory and jace are fairly weak characters, also. i said that i didn't care much about their relationship, and this is because i didn't care much about them. at the beginning, we're introduced to jace as someone who is very straight-laced and who has a major grudge against drunk drivers (more so than the average person), but this is never explained or expanded on after this. memory is a bit of a caricature, i found. she was fun-loving and wild and whatever, and there wasn't much more to her personality. i just felt like we could've had more depth with the characters.   new adult contemporary novels hinge on depth of character, because their plots are very similar. you have to fall in love with the characters and the writing for the novel to stand out amongst the sea of similar ones. unfortunately, this book did neither for me, and i found it a bit of a disappointment. it's an average na novel, and i can see some people liking it, but overall it did nothing for me!",

         "i have to admit that this is my first dave eggars, and it was ok. i can tell he's a talented writer, but i had a major misgiving with a major choice he made. so, i guess what i need to do is to judge eggars by his other well-known books: a heartbreaking work of staggering genius, what is the what, and you shall know our velocity.   this book is about a middle-aged salesman who has gone to saudi arabia to sell the king a new teleconferencing technology. the salesman - a bit of a modern willy loman - is named alan clay. clay has failed at other businesses, mainly because the world changed on him; america became less about making products (like bicycles) and more about selling knowledge (like holographic teleconferencing technology). clay is divorced from a fiery, somewhat egoistic wife; he is also paying his daughter's way through columbia, so he must make this sale in a business he doesn't understand too well. he is depending on his old-school salesman charm in a country and a world that is foreign to him, with culture, habits, and mores that are odd and precarious.   i get what eggars is saying. perhaps, like america lost its manufacturing edge, we will lose our technological savvy, too. our old skills will leave us abandoned and lonely, like loman and clay. globalism is knocking the world's king - america - off it's capitalistic throne. for clay to not end up like loman, he must adjust to the new world order.   all that is awesome. however, i kept flashing back to the famous death of a salesman line: \"attention must be paid.\" does it? does clay deserve our attention?   eggars seems to think so. (or why would he write the book)? however, eggars does something so wrongheaded that he hinders his protagonist's ability to capture our hearts and build empathy. eggars tells the story in third person. this choice creates distance and drains the story of its ability to affect us. even though there is not a single page of this story that clay isn't on - not a single moment clay isn't living through - eggars chooses to talk about clay in a dispassionate, omnipotent voice instead of truly getting into his protagonist's heart and head.   eggars reminded me of why i dislike another author, don delillo - all the cold reporting. i was frustrated, because i wasn't deeply invested in clay, despite the interesting economic and cultural comments eggars was making. instead, the story was more like a news report than a novel. i understood, but the chilly approach made me care less than i could have.",

         "coco swan's mother named her after her heroine, coco chanel and always promised her that one day she would buy coco a chanel handbag. twenty years after her mother's death, whilst looking through a box of odds and ends that has been included in auction lot she purchased for the family antique shop, coco unearths what looks to be a genuine chanel bag. hidden inside is the most romantic letter imaginable. coco believes it is fate, a sign from her mother, and that she must track down the original owner of the bag and letter and reunite them.   what follows is an irish tale full of gentle wit and humour that will make you chuckle and packed with colourful characters, such as coco's nan ruth, who is full of fun and determined not to grow old gracefully. that is how i want to be at her age!   as coco unearths the secret of the bag's original owner, she stumbles upon a story that is totally different from the one she expected to uncover, and incredibly sad. as i was reading the book, about half way through, i suddenly had a lightbulb moment and thought \"ha, i know how this is going to end\". i was convinced i knew, and i am so glad that the author didn't do what i thought, and still managed to surprise me at the end.   to sum up, this is a lovely read, funny, warm, charming and with some poignant moments that will give you food for thought.",
