  the rose garden is a masterwork of suspenseful romance. with vivid descriptions of the unchanging atlantic and its salt spray, the green of the hilly cornwall estate's rose gardens, and faithful renditions of the tensions and way of life of two very different eras, ms. kearsley melds past and present into a coherent whole that firmly anchors the reader into each time period. we live eva's confusion, disbelief and terror as she fades in and out of a past where danger lurks at every turn.   both eva and daniel are people of their eras, but unique enough to accept something as outlandish as time travel, and to love a person of extraordinary background. daniel is as forceful as any eighteenth century man, but he also possesses the sensitivity a modern woman appreciates. and while eva has plenty of twenty-first century backbone, she is smart enough to adapt to the harsh conditions in 1715 without betraying herself.   the romance is breath-taking, as eva and daniel, stronger together than singly, seek to triumph over villains and situations that would have destroyed lesser souls. and ms. kearsley leaves us gasping at the end with a corker of a surprise.   read the rose garden . you'll be happy you did.   arc provided by sourcebooks</td></tr><tr><td>000671601b00cc04bd8eaf95de8f1ab4</td><td>my copy, provided by the author in exchange for an honest review, is for the second edition from rocky ridge books. nice presentation, btw.   this second book in the dark angels series is an excellent second look at the band and all its gay members. josh and robin showed up in the first book as supporting characters to larger than life angel and his waffling bisexual love interest dare. we could see clearly from their brief moments in the first book that there are issues.   a huge theme is \"who is family?\" and \"what does that mean?\" the band's prurient audiences love the idea of twincest, (which for me is automatic back button) but the guys are stepbrothers. it's a close enough connection to keep things from being simple for robin. if they're brothers, they have the unbreakable connection of family, but if they're lovers, they have the possibility of the relationship unraveling. robin can't bear to risk the loss of josh, not seeing how he's risking the very loss he fears.   that luscious cover is your first hint to put on your yaoi glasses, because some things that work in that mindset would work less well in a straight contemporary. once i'd adjusted, i could ease up on the aggravation of the plot, because the main thread is robin's \"i can't have what i want\" vs josh's \"i'm trying to give you what you want, damn it!\" hitting robin with every cluebat under the sun became necessary, and i actually wanted to spank some sense into him. he'd probably enjoy it anyway.   however, i was very annoyed with him because he was getting what he wanted and making sure no one, including himself, was happy about it. fear not, there are attitude adjustments. we get to watch robin slowly remove his head from dark places. bless josh for being a rock of determination and sticking out robin's endless waffling. it helps to not think too hard about the timeline.   it wouldn't be a z allora book without lots and lots of hot sex, would it? not always happy sex, but that's kind of the point: they have to work for their happiness, and that's harder than achieving orgasms. the book wanders into a bit of bdsm-lite, which makes perfect sense in context and isn't so much as to squick this non-bdsm reader.   the other members of the band weave in and out of josh and robin's story, so we can see how angel and dare are getting along, and watch dusty fight a few inner demons with information and references. these guys are all evolving, and they're all farther along at the end of the book, but nothing's wrapped up so tightly that it's the end of the story. which is good news, because that means i'll get another couple of books to read.</td></tr><tr><td>00076d5127e698fa6386a108bf6b3b49</td><td>2.5/5 let's just say that for me this occupies the second place, between 'anna' and 'lola'.   i enjoyed this book. i really did. but. there's quite a big 'but'. i'm going to explain myself. i enjoyed the first half of it, their meeting, them getting to know each other, their back and forth punch-lines and jokes, the extremely cheesy dialogues, the comics references.. but.   some situations looked surreal, somewhat rushed and pretty cliche-y, like her crush on him, and him confessing he's always been attracted to her.. and still that's not my point.what prevented me from remotely liking this book, was isla herself.   isla is the one of the most frustrating character i have encountered. she really stressed me out with her insecurities and emotional ranting. i needed to breathe in between pages that i almost didn't want to finish the book. she revealed herself as a very immature girl. she has so many troubles with herself, her personality, as well as her self-confidence and way of seeing things. she can never make a damn choice!   anyway, i'm so relieved i've finished this non-sense series. disappointment in every sense of the word.</td></tr><tr><td>000840728ece4129d2c437e7dbdc4148</td><td>see my reviews at the las vegas review-journal's book nook at www.lvrj.com/blogs/booknook.</td></tr><tr><td>0008423c9faf30b7956c58987e4e49b9</td><td>this is a paranormal/science fiction story with a twist, as if blending the two genre's isn't enough. the protagonist, fifteen year old kelsa, is trying to deal with her father's recent death from cancer in the not too distant future. and while science has given us many new labor-saving and entertainment devices, including flying cars that do need a road, we also have more sickness, more government controls and more terrorism. including a botched attempt at eco-terrorism that is destrying trees in the amazon rainforest and moving north toward the forests of america.   kelsa meets a strange yound man who calls himself raven. at first she takes him for a stalker, especially when she finds he has dug up the plot where she placed her father's ashes. over time he convinces her that magic is real, that he is a shapeshifter who can ustilize magic, and that he needs her in a quest to heal something broken in nature to save both the forests and humanity itself. it's delightful to see a heroine engaged in a quest to save the world.   raven is the trickster from american indian legends. this story blends legendary creatures from across histories and cultures with science fiction (they are actually from other dimensions that touch and interact with earth). raven claims that she is one of the few humans living, perhaps the only one, who can use magic to cure the damage mankind has done to the earth. she reluctantly takes up the cause and finds herself a pawn in a battle between raven and the other dimensional creatures who have decided mankind deserves to die and do not want the damage repaired in time to save the earth. they are willing to do anything to stop her,including destroying both her and raven.   i was pulled into the mythology and the future world where people have learned to accept being tracked by their dna and needing permission to move from state to state. (i really liked that canada did not have as many hang-up in that area as the united states did). i loved the shape-shifting trickster and how the author blended different legends, and i realized before kelsa did that the trickster had more secrets up his sleeve than he revealed. the tension grew when we learned he was long-lived, but not immortal, and that if his enemies managed to stop him, humanity was doomed. i also loved her determination, and her feelings for her father and how that played into her quest.   my problem with this book came at the end. tension built as i watched themmove across north america, one step ahead, or sometimes behind, their enemies. and then, suddenly, raven ran out of energy. the explaination for why this happened felt weak, and led to a let-down ending where kelsa passes on her quest to another and returns home. this is another book that is obviously crying for a sequel. unfortunatly kelsa's story is gone. the trickster has to move on to find another unlikely human to continue the job of saving the earth.</td></tr><tr><td>0008ad99cab8191f3eb09476c74d6e10</td><td>i really, really enjoyed so much about this book!   im pretty sure this is carrie butler's debut novel, and i have to give her full praise for the way she writes. the characters really came alive for me, and i could totally 'hear' their voices. the storyline moves quickly, without any slow points, but isnt rushed. i was really hooked on this book from the very first pages. there's nothing groundbreaking about this storyline- ive read much the same thing plenty of times before, but carrie's writing really made this one a stand out for me.   i'd say for the first 80%, strength really reads like a contemporary romance novel. a lot of the paranormal elements don't appear until much later in the book. its mentioned in parts, to set it up, but the main story line follows the budding relationship between wallace and rena. i love rena! she has so much spunk and attitude, and she just plain cracked me up in parts. some of her lines were so clever and funny that i had to go straight to goodreads to quote her. :) i love that carrie took so much time in building the relationship between them. yay for no instalove!   strength was absolutely headed for a 5 star rating from me, until the ending. it wasn't that it was bad, it just wasn't quite what i was expecting. a lot of (paranormal) information, and some new characters are thrown at you in that last 20% and i found it a bit confusing. the picture in my head went from crystal clear, to a bit fuzzy as i tried to follow what was happening.   nevertheless, strength was a great read, and i'll definitely be looking forward to reading the sequel.   *although strength is classed as new adult, and is about early 20's characters in college, the language and heat level were both pretty tame, so if that sort of thing offends you about novels, then you'll be fine with this book*   *i received a copy of this book from the author in exchange for an honest review. this does not in any way affect my opinion of the book*</td></tr><tr><td>0008c54e6ff69a02f01ddc405c1fd8e4</td><td>i liked how this story was told, with first person chapters and third person chapters. it was so interesting finding out more about catalina/katherine of aragon - first wife of henry viii and born to be the princess of wales. she was betrothed to henry's older brother, arthur, from birth and married him when she was 16. tragically he died after only five months of marriage. then she married henry and became katherine. she was a great queen but history only remembers her as the beheaded first wife of henry viii. looking forward to reading more in this series.</td></tr></tbody></table></div>"

         "my copy, provided by the author in exchange for an honest review, is for the second edition from rocky ridge books. nice presentation, btw.   this second book in the dark angels series is an excellent second look at the band and all its gay members. josh and robin showed up in the first book as supporting characters to larger than life angel and his waffling bisexual love interest dare. we could see clearly from their brief moments in the first book that there are issues.   a huge theme is \"who is family?\" and \"what does that mean?\" the band's prurient audiences love the idea of twincest, (which for me is automatic back button) but the guys are stepbrothers. it's a close enough connection to keep things from being simple for robin. if they're brothers, they have the unbreakable connection of family, but if they're lovers, they have the possibility of the relationship unraveling. robin can't bear to risk the loss of josh, not seeing how he's risking the very loss he fears.   that luscious cover is your first hint to put on your yaoi glasses, because some things that work in that mindset would work less well in a straight contemporary. once i'd adjusted, i could ease up on the aggravation of the plot, because the main thread is robin's \"i can't have what i want\" vs josh's \"i'm trying to give you what you want, damn it!\" hitting robin with every cluebat under the sun became necessary, and i actually wanted to spank some sense into him. he'd probably enjoy it anyway.   however, i was very annoyed with him because he was getting what he wanted and making sure no one, including himself, was happy about it. fear not, there are attitude adjustments. we get to watch robin slowly remove his head from dark places. bless josh for being a rock of determination and sticking out robin's endless waffling. it helps to not think too hard about the timeline.   it wouldn't be a z allora book without lots and lots of hot sex, would it? not always happy sex, but that's kind of the point: they have to work for their happiness, and that's harder than achieving orgasms. the book wanders into a bit of bdsm-lite, which makes perfect sense in context and isn't so much as to squick this non-bdsm reader.   the other members of the band weave in and out of josh and robin's story, so we can see how angel and dare are getting along, and watch dusty fight a few inner demons with information and references. these guys are all evolving, and they're all farther along at the end of the book, but nothing's wrapped up so tightly that it's the end of the story. which is good news, because that means i'll get another couple of books to read."

         "2.5/5 let's just say that for me this occupies the second place, between 'anna' and 'lola'.   i enjoyed this book. i really did. but. there's quite a big 'but'. i'm going to explain myself. i enjoyed the first half of it, their meeting, them getting to know each other, their back and forth punch-lines and jokes, the extremely cheesy dialogues, the comics references.. but.   some situations looked surreal, somewhat rushed and pretty cliche-y, like her crush on him, and him confessing he's always been attracted to her.. and still that's not my point.what prevented me from remotely liking this book, was isla herself.   isla is the one of the most frustrating character i have encountered. she really stressed me out with her insecurities and emotional ranting. i needed to breathe in between pages that i almost didn't want to finish the book. she revealed herself as a very immature girl. she has so many troubles with herself, her personality, as well as her self-confidence and way of seeing things. she can never make a damn choice!   anyway, i'm so relieved i've finished this non-sense series. disappointment in every sense of the word."

         "this is a paranormal/science fiction story with a twist, as if blending the two genre's isn't enough. the protagonist, fifteen year old kelsa, is trying to deal with her father's recent death from cancer in the not too distant future. and while science has given us many new labor-saving and entertainment devices, including flying cars that do need a road, we also have more sickness, more government controls and more terrorism. including a botched attempt at eco-terrorism that is destrying trees in the amazon rainforest and moving north toward the forests of america.   kelsa meets a strange yound man who calls himself raven. at first she takes him for a stalker, especially when she finds he has dug up the plot where she placed her father's ashes. over time he convinces her that magic is real, that he is a shapeshifter who can ustilize magic, and that he needs her in a quest to heal something broken in nature to save both the forests and humanity itself. it's delightful to see a heroine engaged in a quest to save the world.   raven is the trickster from american indian legends. this story blends legendary creatures from across histories and cultures with science fiction (they are actually from other dimensions that touch and interact with earth). raven claims that she is one of the few humans living, perhaps the only one, who can use magic to cure the damage mankind has done to the earth. she reluctantly takes up the cause and finds herself a pawn in a battle between raven and the other dimensional creatures who have decided mankind deserves to die and do not want the damage repaired in time to save the earth. they are willing to do anything to stop her,including destroying both her and raven.   i was pulled into the mythology and the future world where people have learned to accept being tracked by their dna and needing permission to move from state to state. (i really liked that canada did not have as many hang-up in that area as the united states did). i loved the shape-shifting trickster and how the author blended different legends, and i realized before kelsa did that the trickster had more secrets up his sleeve than he revealed. the tension grew when we learned he was long-lived, but not immortal, and that if his enemies managed to stop him, humanity was doomed. i also loved her determination, and her feelings for her father and how that played into her quest.   my problem with this book came at the end. tension built as i watched themmove across north america, one step ahead, or sometimes behind, their enemies. and then, suddenly, raven ran out of energy. the explaination for why this happened felt weak, and led to a let-down ending where kelsa passes on her quest to another and returns home. this is another book that is obviously crying for a sequel. unfortunatly kelsa's story is gone. the trickster has to move on to find another unlikely human to continue the job of saving the earth."

         "i really, really enjoyed so much about this book!   im pretty sure this is carrie butler's debut novel, and i have to give her full praise for the way she writes. the characters really came alive for me, and i could totally 'hear' their voices. the storyline moves quickly, without any slow points, but isnt rushed. i was really hooked on this book from the very first pages. there's nothing groundbreaking about this storyline- ive read much the same thing plenty of times before, but carrie's writing really made this one a stand out for me.   i'd say for the first 80%, strength really reads like a contemporary romance novel. a lot of the paranormal elements don't appear until much later in the book. its mentioned in parts, to set it up, but the main story line follows the budding relationship between wallace and rena. i love rena! she has so much spunk and attitude, and she just plain cracked me up in parts. some of her lines were so clever and funny that i had to go straight to goodreads to quote her. :) i love that carrie took so much time in building the relationship between them. yay for no instalove!   strength was absolutely headed for a 5 star rating from me, until the ending. it wasn't that it was bad, it just wasn't quite what i was expecting. a lot of (paranormal) information, and some new characters are thrown at you in that last 20% and i found it a bit confusing. the picture in my head went from crystal clear, to a bit fuzzy as i tried to follow what was happening.   nevertheless, strength was a great read, and i'll definitely be looking forward to reading the sequel.   *although strength is classed as new adult, and is about early 20's characters in college, the language and heat level were both pretty tame, so if that sort of thing offends you about novels, then you'll be fine with this book*   *i received a copy of this book from the author in exchange for an honest review. this does not in any way affect my opinion of the book*"

book by this author by her writing by her realness by the characters by the concept that i had no choice but to read the first book in the series this is the story of john palmer and shannon murphy john is one of founders of lost n found investigative agency a detective agency organized and run by wounded vets john is quite the gruff unfriendly kind of guy he was paralyzed from an injury but yes he can wink and has become even more unsociable since being stuck in a wheel chair his past is a sad and lonely one so the reader can see why he is the way he is shannon has recently been hired by the agency as the office manager from the beginning they notice each other but because each has quite a set of baggage they don t act on any attraction they may have that is until john notices that shannon seems off and wants to know why it turns out that something has gone terribly wrong she had a very scary stalker years ago but he is in prison now yet many of the same things are starting to happen that he did years ago a pepsi can left where she can t help but see it and it has the stalkers finger prints yet he is in jail john takes no time in moving in with her to protect her and get the rest of agency on the case this one didn t get to me quite as much as embattled minds while the previous is a NUM this one would be a NUM NUM NUM if we could give NUM NUM marks i love a gruff teddy bear type of hero but i didn t find john teddy bearish he is reluctant to believe that shannon could really be interested in him at all he was often rude and while i could understand why he is the way he is he just doesn t have that inner marshmallow that makes this kind of hero so attractive i like shannon though she isn t a real stand out kind of heroine i did appreciate how calm and collected she remained despite the threat she is under and i also liked how she wasn t bothered at all by john s infirmity she wants him she goes after him that simple like the first one i read embattled hearts this one is also novella size in length but again like the first one i found the story and the characters to be very well developed i ve already started reading the next one in the series embattled home and expect that it won t take me long to finish it either and i just want to make mention that there seems to be another investigator private detective type series entitled lost and found which seems to also be a group of vets returned from war i haven t read this other series but want to make everyone aware the author of the series i m reading at the moment is j m madden

suffering an illness that has weakened her constitution and has relapses she feels her place will be with one of her sisters when they are married and have children she can help and find fulfillment in that aspect of her life fate intervenes and she meets max buchanan as a reader it is not hard to like max he shows olivia that there is more to life and she can do anything she wants the secrecy of her health was unnecessary but later it does give max a better picture on why her family protects her so much there is a definite villain in this story that is an awful awful character his storyline is a strong secondary story along with his poor wife secrets of an accidental duchess started off as a stronger story than book one confessions of an improper bride but quickly fizzled and in my opinion is a forgettable book once read this reader is chalking it up to finding an author that doesn t work for me and i will not continue with this series i recommend this book only to fans of the

appropriately a fantasy novel with blood angst dragons minotaur skyrim worth of adventure poltics and of course gwenvael the poor dragon who always get punched by everyone in the last two books all the thoughts of the author into this one book never cease to amaze me the plot really did make more sense with the whole world building in the book gwenvael was toned down in this one to complement with dagmar s sensibilities and occasional sarcasm we get to see the continuation of the last two story in this one which someone create a whole new subplots inside the main story line i thought that she would go like most serial authors who give happily ever afters to their characters and wrote blandly about them in the subsequent books there s a lot of intelligent quotes in this one and although i don t crack into laughter like the previous ones i thoroughly enjoyed the plot and the characters authors really need to take aiken s style of writing since she complements every scenes with minimal description but enough suspense and plot lines and make them memorable on their own i can t stop saying that i adore the author and her complex intelligence to bring it out in writing</td></tr><tr><td>000c29d5198b932bfd167ce9ca31c611</td><td>i thought that this book was the best in the series of three i read it much quicker than the rest of the series and definitely found

with the first book by this author by her writing by her realness by the characters by the concept that i had no choice but to read the first book in the series this is the story of john palmer and shannon murphy john is one of founders of lost n found investigative agency a detective agency organized and run by wounded vets john is quite the gruff unfriendly kind of guy he was paralyzed from an injury but yes he can wink and has become even more unsociable since being stuck in a wheel chair his past is a sad and lonely one so the reader can see why he is the way he is shannon has recently been hired by the agency as the office manager from the beginning they notice each other but because each has quite a set of baggage they don t act on any attraction they may have that is until john notices that shannon seems off and wants to know why it turns out that something has gone terribly wrong she had a very scary stalker years ago but he is in prison now yet many of the same things are starting to happen that he did years ago a pepsi can left where she can t help but see it and it has the stalkers finger prints yet he is in jail john takes no time in moving in with her to protect her and get the rest of agency on the case this one didn t get to me quite as much as embattled minds while the previous is a NUM this one would be a NUM NUM NUM if we could give NUM NUM marks i love a gruff teddy bear type of hero but i didn t find john teddy bearish he is reluctant to believe that shannon could really be interested in him at all he was often rude and while i could understand why he is the way he is he just doesn t have that inner marshmallow that makes this kind of hero so attractive i like shannon though she isn t a real stand out kind of heroine i did appreciate how calm and collected she remained despite the threat she is under and i also liked how she wasn t bothered at all by john s infirmity she wants him she goes after him that simple like the first one i read embattled hearts this one is also novella size in length but again like the first one i found the story and the characters to be very well developed i ve already started reading the next one in the series embattled home and expect that it won t take me long to finish it either and i just want to make mention that there seems to be another investigator private detective type series entitled lost and found which seems to also be a group of vets returned from war i haven t read this other series but want to make everyone aware the author of the series i m reading at the moment is j m madden

gwenvael the poor dragon who always get punched by everyone in the last two books all the thoughts of the author into this one book never cease to amaze me the plot really did make more sense with the whole world building in the book gwenvael was toned down in this one to complement with dagmar s sensibilities and occasional sarcasm we get to see the continuation of the last two story in this one which someone create a whole new subplots inside the main story line i thought that she would go like most serial authors who give happily ever afters to their characters and wrote blandly about them in the subsequent books there s a lot of intelligent quotes in this one and although i don t crack into laughter like the previous ones i thoroughly enjoyed the plot and the characters authors really need to take aiken s style of writing since she complements every scenes with minimal description but enough suspense and plot lines and make them memorable on their own i can t stop saying that i

         "my husband purchased this book and since it was lying ab0ut i picked it up and read it it s what i do i haven t played this game but it was very video game ish in the reading it has quests and bosses and side quests and side bosses the hero gathers treasure and saves people overall i think playing the game would be more entertaining since you actually get to figure out things but reading about it is certainly quicker the first few pages are in color and they are beautiful but the rest are black and white the drawings are good but i had trouble following the action as it seemed like fight scenes were just too chaotic for me i admit i didn t spend much time trying to puzzle them out",
